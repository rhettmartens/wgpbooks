    <h1>Why You, Are The Best!</h1>
    <p>
        I know I don't tell you often enough, but without you I honestly don't know who I would be today. Your love has always been there, to guide me and comfort me. You've been a pillar for me to stand on when life got hard, and you've never been afraid to tell me what I may not want to hear because you know what is good for me! You're kind, thoughtful, caring, and so full of love I can barely contain all of it. You're my best friend, my partner in crime, and someone I know I can always have a laugh with.
    </p>
    <p>
        You also always have really great taste in books. I know we don't talk about it often enough, but your love for reading has been an encouragement to me, and your taste in what you read has given me a chance to really stretch myself and grow. I love your sense of humor, and your ability to talk about all kinds of things. There is never a dull moment between us and for that I am so thankful. I am so glad to have you in my life!

        Because of your spirit of helping other's, and because I can't give much this year in monetary gifts, I thought I would give you something else. With this letter you have my pledge that I will dedicate 20hrs. of volunteer time at a local pet shelter or animal rescue. I will email you the specifics, but I hope that this can be a token of service in honor of you! Thank you for showing me what it means to give back. I love that about you!
